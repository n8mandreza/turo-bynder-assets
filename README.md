# Turo Assets (Hosted Figma Plugin UI)

## About

This application serves as the UI for the Turo Assets plugin. It's hosted on the internet and rendered in the plugin's UI iframe in order to satisfy CORS requirements.

It's built with Remix, which utilizes Vite. See the [Remix docs](https://remix.run/docs) and the [Remix Vite docs](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/future/vite) for details on supported features.

## Development

Run the Vite dev server:

```shellscript
npm run dev
```

## Deployment

First, build your app for production:

```sh
npm run build
```

Then run the app in production mode:

```sh
npm start
```

Now you'll need to pick a host to deploy it to.

### DIY

If you're familiar with deploying Node applications, the built-in Remix app server is production-ready.

Make sure to deploy the output of `npm run build`

- `build/server`
- `build/client`
